# Image Processing Project - Group 3
Code Description:<br/>
     The main code is separated into 4 files: backend.py, gui.py, app.py, and start.py<br/>
        1- The backend file contains global variables that are used in the other files alongside functions that transforms a parameter and returns the result back to the calling function.<br/>
        2- The gui file contains controls creation, initialization, styling, and organization into one layout named appLayout<br/>
        3- The app file initializes the controls in the gui file and acts as a mediator between the controls in the gui file and the functions in the backend file <br/>
        4- The start file contains the method that runs the application<br/>
     <br/>
Application Setup:<br/>
     1- Make sure that python is installed<br/>
     2- A file containing all the requirements is placed inside the project directory. Use the following code to run it:<br/>

     3- Use python to run the start file:<br/>
