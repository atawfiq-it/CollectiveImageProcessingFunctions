# Collective Image Processing Functions
## Code Description:
The main code is separated into 4 files: **backend.py**, **gui.py**, **app.py**, and **start.py**<br/>
  1. The backend file contains global variables that are used in the other files alongside functions that transforms a parameter and returns the result back to the calling function.<br/>
  2. The gui file contains controls creation, initialization, styling, and organization into one layout named appLayout<br/>
  3. The app file initializes the controls in the gui file and acts as a mediator between the controls in the gui file and the functions in the backend file<br/>
  4. The start file contains the method that runs the application<br/>
     
## Application Setup:
  1. Make sure that python is installed<br/>
  2. A file containing all the requirements is placed inside the project directory. Use the following code to run it:<br/>
  `pip install -r requirements.txt`<br/>
  3. Use python to run the start file:<br/>
  `python start.py`<br/>
